Hi. That’s how I managed to solve this

Fitst of all you need to find all the files with destroyed timestamp

find yournextcloudfilelocation/ ! -newermt 1970-01-02 > damaged.txt
then use this script to touch and modify the date. You can set whatewer the date you want just change 15 jan

#!/bin/bash

file="damaged.tx"

while read -r line; do
    touch -d '15 jan' "$line"
done <$file

Then If you use docker

sudo docker exec --user www-data your containerID php occ files:scan --all
if you don’t use docker then

occ files:scan --all
after that you need to sync all your clients from scratch
